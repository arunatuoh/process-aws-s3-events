Project Title: File Upload Notifier

Project Description:

Create a system that monitors an S3 bucket for new file uploads, triggers an AWS Lambda function when a new file is uploaded, and sends a notification using Amazon SNS to notify users about the uploaded file. This project can be a great way to learn and practice using these AWS services together.

Project Components:

S3 Bucket: Create an S3 bucket where users can upload files. This will be the source of events that trigger your Lambda function.

AWS Lambda Function: Create a Lambda function that is triggered whenever a new file is uploaded to the S3 bucket. The Lambda function should perform the following tasks:

Retrieve information about the uploaded file, such as its name, size, and the user who uploaded it.
Create a notification message with details about the uploaded file.
Publish this message to an Amazon SNS topic.
Amazon SNS Topic: Create an SNS topic where you publish the notification messages generated by the Lambda function.

Subscriber Endpoints: Configure SNS to notify subscribers (e.g., email addresses, SMS endpoints, or even other Lambda functions) when a new message is published to the topic.

Logging and Error Handling: Implement logging and error handling in your Lambda function to track the processing of events and handle any issues that may arise.

Project Workflow:

Users upload files to the S3 bucket.
S3 generates an event when a new file is uploaded.
The S3 event triggers the Lambda function.
The Lambda function processes the event, generates a notification message, and publishes it to the SNS topic.
Subscribers receive notifications about the newly uploaded files.
Possible Extensions:

Implement different notification formats (e.g., email notifications, SMS messages, or push notifications) for subscribers.
Add security and authentication mechanisms to control access to the S3 bucket.
Store metadata about the uploaded files in a database for tracking and reporting purposes.
Implement versioning and archiving of uploaded files.
Add a web interface to allow users to view and manage their uploaded files.
This project allows you to explore AWS services for event-driven architecture, notification systems, and serverless computing. It also provides practical experience in integrating these services to solve a real-world problem.
